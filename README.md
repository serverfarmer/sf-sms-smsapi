sf-sms-smsapi extension provides a simple SMS sender script, written as shell-only
(without any dependiences except curl) client for polish smsapi.pl service.

There are more sf-sms-* extensions expected, so core SMS sender script should be
always executed as /usr/local/bin/sf-sms, which links to the proper extension.
